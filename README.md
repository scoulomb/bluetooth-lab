## Overview

Following https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth, bluetooth uses the same radio frequencies as the Wifi.

Low Energy is achieved by using larger and fewer channels.

Maximum throughput seems to be 8Mbits/s (HDR8) on a wide 4Mhz channel (limited by the relatively slow clock used. This slow clock is also the reason for the relative high latency in bluetooth).


## Networks

A single device can communicate with another 7 devices in a piconet. Piconets can be linked together to form scatternets.

## Roles

Devices follow a master/slave approach, but they can exchange roles. A device can be the slave of multiple masters, and a master can talk to up to 7 slaves (switching between each in a round-robin fashion).

## Protocol

The bluetooth protocol is designed differently from the OSI model used for Internet, and doesn't preserve a very clear distinctions between all the layers:

![](./Bluetooth_protokoly.svg)

This seems to be linked to the teams having worked on the protocal and Conway's law (ref: Tanenbaum network book).

### Link Manager

The link manager is in charge of establishing the connection with other link managers (devices), and to also handle authentication.

### Host Controller Interface (HCI)

Mainly finds other bluetooth devices on the network.

Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP)
The L2CAP is a protocol used to transmit data.

It has 2 variants:

- Enhanced Retransmission Mode (ERTM): basically equivalent to TCP traffic
- Streaming Mode (SM): basically equivalent to UDP traffic

### Service Discovery Protocol (SDP)
The SDP allows discovering services/profiles a device offers:

- each service has a UUID;
- each service defines a specific profile.

For example, a profile might be there to handle a headset's play/pause communication, while another profile might be there to handle the actual audio data transmission.

üìù some profiles are only visible after a devices has been authentication, for security purposes.

### Audio/Video Control Transport Protocol (AVCTP)

AVCTP defines ways to send/receive commands controlling audio and video streams, such as play, pause, next, etc used by the Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) profile.

### Audio/Video Distribution Transport Protocol (AVDTP)

AVDTP defines ways to send/receive audio and video streams by the advanced audio distribution (A2DP) profile.

### Other protocols

Other protocols can be used such as OBEX, IP/TCP/UDP, PPP, WAP, etc carried through bluetooth.

Those might be used for sending files through bluetooth (some phones do that).

## Connections

### Discovery
Each device can be in discovery mode, and transmit some information if requested, such as name, class, list of services.

üìù the name does not have to be unique, and this can potentially lead to name squatting, or having people try to connect to devices they think they control because the name is identical.

### Pairing (and bonding)

For security reasons, not all devices should automatically connect to each other, and require pairing.

The idea is to share and store a shared secret between 2 devices. Once this is done, the devices are bonded.

This is achieved through the Secure Simple Pairing (SSP) process (unless old bluetooth < 2.1 used). Multiple ways exist for the SSP to succeed, depending on the capabilities of the devices:

- Just Works: aka, automatic secret sharing with optional confirmation by the user. Simple, but not very secure (never saw it in reality);
- Numeric comparison: if both devices have a display, a 6-digit code is shown on both devices, and the user must confirm it is the same on one of the devices (never saw it in reality);
- Passkey Entry: if only one of the devices has a display, and the other one has a way to enter digits (such as a keyboard), the user must enter the 6-digit code in the other devices for confirmation (can be seen when setting up a new iPad with an existing iPhone for example, or some Android TVs);
Out of band: the confirmation is sent on a different medium and/or at a different time (eg: by email, on an NFC token, etc.) (might be used when bringing a phone close to a device to pair them, one of them containing an NFC token);

## Profiles
Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bluetooth_profiles

### Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP)
This allows uni-directional transfer of up to 2 audio channels.

This is done by using some audio codecs, most of which are optional and can be extended by manufacturers:

- SBC (mandatory codex, easy to implement, low quality);
- everything else is optional:
  - MPG 2/3/4;
  - ATRAC;
  - aptX;
  - LDAC;
  = etc.

üìù No lossless codec is used yet (probably due to the lack of bandwidth to use FLAC).

Some of those codecs also support DRMs.

Manufacturers tend to market and differentiate themselves on those supported codecs (especially for headphones).

Yet, high-end manufacturers of AV devices may only support the bare minimum codec (SBC), such as the Denon AVR-X2700H stating a support of A2DP 1.2 SBC.

### Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP)

Each version of AVRCP adds functionalities to control an audio device (such as a HiFi system, a TV or a car audio system):

- play, pause, volume, etc;
- status (playing, paused, etc);
- track metadata (artist, track name, etc);
- searching and browsing;
- sending albums covers.

### Human Interface Device Profile (HID)

Mouses, keyboards and game controllers use the Human Interface Device (HID) protocol, just like the HID profile is carried through USB otherwise.

### Listing devices and connecting

We can check the list of devices, but it's empty:

````
$ bluetoothctl devices

Let's scan for devices:

````
$ bluetoothctl scan on

After a while, we can stop and check the discovered devices:

On another computer, both using wireshark and btmon, we can only capture the non-data packets (in this case the ATT protocol for bluetooth low energy):

Many other tools exist to check for bluetooth traffic: https://www.kali.org/tools/bluez/, each specialized with one protocol.


## Optional notes

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bluetooth_profiles

> Each A2DP service, of possibly many, is designed to uni-directionally transfer an audio stream in up to 2 channel stereo, either to or from the Bluetooth host.[2] This profile relies on AVDTP and GAVDP

- Do not check if Atoll has apt-x 

- Parallel with service discovery and co here: https://github.com/scoulomb/home-assistant/blob/main/sound-video/README.md#sound-1
